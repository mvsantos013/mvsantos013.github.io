My way of working is learning about the business logic, identifying the problems and requirements from stakeholders, and then proposing and developing solutions/architectures that are scalable, maintainable and cost-effective. I have leaded teams in the past and I&#39;m used to work in fast-paced environment places. My favorite stack is <b>Python</b>, <b>Nodejs</b>, <b>Vue</b>, <b>React</b> and <b>AWS</b> services in general. </p></section><section id="outras_atividades"><h4>Experience</h4><p><ul class="no-bullets"><li><div><span class="highlight">Software Engineer Specialist at Pixida do Brasil</span> <span class="small text-muted">2023 - now</span></div><div><p> As a full-stack and data engineer specialist at Pixida, I&#39;m responsible for architecting and developing systems for the BMW group QA team. I build systems that improve the analysis of the quality of cars geospatial related features. The systems are based on AWS and are developed in Python and Nodejs while the frontend is developed in React. </p><p> I&#39;m responsible for the entire system such as the backend, frontend, devops as well the ingestion, integration and processing of geospatial data. </p><p>Stack: AWS, Python, Nodejs, React, Github Actions, Serverless Framework, ECS, Docker, EMR, Geoserver, PostgreSQL</p></div></li><li><div><span class="highlight">Software Engineer at Hashdex</span> <span class="small text-muted">2020 - 2022 (3 years)</span></div><div><p> I conceived the architecture and developed an asset management system. The system contains numerous utilities/automations and it&#39;s used internally by Hashdex and partners. It&#39;s an ecosystem of microservices (Lambda) on a serverless event-driven architecture (SNS / SQS / DynamoDB). Most of the microservices were written in Python while the user interface was developed in VueJS + TailwindCSS + Quasar. System security is based on multiple factors such as internal network (VPN), oauth authentication (Cognito), authorization (ABAC) and MFAs. </p><p> I worked on the development of the company&#39;s main website (2021 version). The UI was developed with NuxtJS (Vue SSR) based on designs on Figma. The CMS was developed using the Strapi Framework. </p><p> I developed the initial structure of Hashdex&#39;s Datalake. I implemented automatic data ingestion routines with Python, AWS Lambda, S3 and Serverless Framework. AWS Glue jobs processed the ingested files and the output data was available for analysis in AWS Athena via SQL queries. </p><p> I co-acted in the development of Marketdata, an application for ingestion and availability of data (price, volume, etc.) in real time for assets and indices. Data ingestion was done by Kubernets pods (AWS EKS), AWS Kinesis and Firehose. The data was processed and then stored in AWS Timestream and Redis for low-latency queries. </p><p> I developed countless automatic routines that considerably reduced the analysts&#39; work time. Their orchestration were done by AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda. </p><p> Most projects were based on serverless architecture, making it possible to build scalable and extremely cheap applications compared to traditional server-based applications. </p><p>Stack: AWS, Vue, Python, Nodejs, React, Github Actions, Docker, Kubernetes...</p></div></li><li><div><span class="highlight">Software Developer Jr. at Wikki Brasil</span> <span class="small text-muted">2019 (6 months)</span></div><div><p> I performed the maintenance and development of new features in a Desktop application from Petrobras.
